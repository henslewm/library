*****Requirements Document***** 

Shall always be referenced in the Design Document. This is the benchmark for evaluating the success of the project.

*****System Design Description*****

This is a written description that completely desribes the system at the architecture level, including subsystems and their services, hardware mapping, data management, access control, global software control structure, and any required boundary conditions.

A software design description document will give the software development team overall guidance regarding the high level architectures that will lead to lower level decisions.

*****Maintenance Information******

This document will detail the required maintenance for components in the system and will include templates to use for accountability. 

*****Supplemental Documentation******

Anything that falls outside the scope of the other documents, or that will aid the user or future developer in navigating decisions of the design will be kept in this folder.

*****System Acceptance Agreement******

There should be a document with signatures from stakeholders accepting the delivered system solution. There should be sections where the stakeholders accept the requirements document, the system design description and the maintenance information.
